# Asuka's Scripting Projects

Welcome to my Roblox script collection! Here you'll find a collection of my projects which I made in my spare time.

## Projects:

### Project 1: [DataStoreDiamonds]
**Description:**
This project utilizes the DataStore service to save and load player data. 
- **Functionality**: 
  - Creates a `leaderstats` folder and an `IntValue` named Diamonds for each player upon joining (`PlayerAdded` event).
  - Loads the player's diamonds data if available.
  - Saves the player's diamonds data using DataStore upon leaving (`PlayerRemoving` event).
- **Persistence**: 
  - The diamonds data is associated with each player's UserId, ensuring it's unique to each player and persists across sessions.
