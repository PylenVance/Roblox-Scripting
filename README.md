Asuka's Scripting projects

Welcome to my roblox script collection! Here you'll find a collection of my projects which i made in spare time.

Projects:
  Project 1: [DataStoreDiamonds]
  Description:
  This uses the DataStore service to save and load player data.
  When a player joins (PlayerAdded event), it creates a leaderstats folder and an IntValue named Diamonds for each player. It then loads the player's diamonds data if available.
  When a player leaves (PlayerRemoving event), it saves the player's diamonds data using DataStore.
  The diamonds data is associated with each player's UserId, ensuring it's unique to each player and persists across sessions.
